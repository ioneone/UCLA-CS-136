1. Is there any way that employees can read the ballots of other users? If so, what could be done to stop this? If not, what prevents them from reading them?

Yes, if larry creates a file in ballots directory, and moe knows the name of the file, then moe can read the content of the file because the default file mode is 0664, which allows `other` to read.

To prevent this, we need to execute `chmod o-r` on every files in ballots directory.








2. What does the 'x' bit mean when applied to directories?

It means you can cd into the directory.








3. Which users on the system can delete arbitrary files in the /tpsreports directory?

root, tps, ken, dmr, bwk








4. Is there any way that non-wheel employees can read files in the /tpsreports directory?

No because `other` has no access at all.








5. What do '0' permissions mean for the owner of a directory? What privileges do they have over files in that directory?

It means the owner cannot list files in the directory, nor create a file in the directory, nor cd into the directory.








6. Is this safe? Why or why not? If it is not safe, is there a better way to give larry this access? If it is safe, how do you know it is safe? (Hint: search online for common sudo issues.)

Granting sudo access to vim is dangerous because the user can then, for example, open /etc/sudoers inside the editor and grant full sudo access to themselves.

Instead, we can grant sudo access only for editing certain files using sudoedit:

larry ALL=(ALL) sudoedit /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf








7: Assuming the init script /etc/init.d/httpd has no unknown vulnerabilities, is it safe to grant larry sudo access to the command /etc/init.d/httpd restart? If this is not secure, explain why.

Yes.








8: Is there some way that moe or curly could subvert this system to gain root privileges? If not, how do you know this is true?

No because they don't have permissions to modify /etc/sudoers.
