1. A description of the security flaw in the FCCU application

The SQL query was not protected from SQL injection. A malicious users was able to login to every user account.

2. A description of how you fixed the flaw. How does your fix solve the problem?

I used prepared statement to fix the flaw. Prepared statements prevent SQL injections.

3. Considering the FCCU application alone, describe a recovery plan for the server, answering:

- How serious was this breach? Could attackers gain root access through this vulnerability?

This breach is very serious. Users' personal information is leaked and money can get wired to somewhere else. No attackers can't gain root access through this vulnerability because mysqli_query() does not allow executing multiple queries, so attacker can't execute something like `COMMAND sudo su -`.

- What should be done with the server in order to secure it?

Use prepared statements to prevent SQL injections.

- Include any other observations or thoughts you might have.

It was fun.
